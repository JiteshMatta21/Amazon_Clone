# Amazon_Clone
Project using html and css try to clone the homepage of Amazon.
I learned many new things in this project.
we used many html and css tags primarily in this project.
Mainly I faced difficulty in setting up the position,which was solved by learning flex property of css.

I also learned some new properties,such as 'background-size' with 'cover' and 'justify-content' with 'space-evenly'.

I also learned how to use the percent(%)roperty for styling in width and height conditions.
